# Welcome to Audio-Visual Experience! ðŸŽ§ðŸŽ¨

Ever wondered what it'd be like if sounds had their own visual vibe? That's what I've been tinkering with here, a blend of beats and visuals, it's been a blast putting it together with the help of an AI LLM assistant

## So, What's the Deal?

What if we could see our favorite sounds in math? Generate the visuals without knowing how. And that's how the Audio-Visual Experience came to life. It's a bit of an experiment, a bit of fun, a whole lot of nerdiness

## Dive into the Mix

- **Audio Engine**: where the sound gets its groove on
- **Visual Engine**: crafting visuals that vibe with the beat
- **UI Elements**: interface that ties it all together
- **Main**: main stage, where everything comes alive

## Fancy a Spin?

1. **Get the Goods**:
   ```
   git clone https://github.com/goggledefogger/audio-visual-experience.git
   ```

2. **Set the Stage**:
   Head to the project directory and:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Let's Roll**:
   ```

   ```
